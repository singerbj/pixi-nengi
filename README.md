# nengi.js - api demo <img src="https://timetocode.com/images/nengi-logo-32x32.png" />


This is a small demo game that shows some of the nengi 2 api being used to do basic things. The version of this project will be synchronized to the version of nengi that it is demonstrating, i.e. if this project is versioned 2.0.0-alpha.123 then that is the version of nengi for which it serves as an example. The primary purpose of this project is to show syntax and api changes via executable code in the interim during which nengi 2.x.x is being frequently changed and thus has no stable documentation.

The game will eventually contain an example of each nengi feature being used. It may be necessary to split it into more projects in the future but for now let's cram stuff in here.


To run the code, use node 18, run `npm install`, and then `npm start` ; visit http://localhost:9000/
